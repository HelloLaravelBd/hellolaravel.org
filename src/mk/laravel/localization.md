## Introduction

Laravel's localization features provide a convenient way to retrieve strings in various languages, allowing you to easily support multiple languages within your application. Language strings are stored in files within the `resources/lang` directory. Within this directory there should be a subdirectory for each language supported by the application:

```php
    /resources
        /lang
            /en
                messages.php
            /es
                messages.php
```
All language files simply return an array of keyed strings. For example:

```php
    <?php

    return [
        'welcome' => 'Welcome to our application'
    ];
```




### Configuring The Locale

The default language for your application is stored in the `config/app.php` configuration file. Of course, you may modify this value to suit the needs of your application. You may also change the active language at runtime using the `setLocale` method on the `App` facade:

```php
    Route::get('welcome/{locale}', function ($locale) {
        App::setLocale($locale);

        //
    });
```


You may configure a "fallback language", which will be used when the active language does not contain a given translation string. Like the default language, the fallback language is also configured in the `config/app.php` configuration file:

    `'fallback_locale' => 'en',`

#### Determining The Current Locale

You may use the `getLocale` and `isLocale` methods on the `App` facade to determine the current locale or check if the locale is a given value:

```php
    $locale = App::getLocale();

    if (App::isLocale('en')) {
        //
    }
```

## Defining Translation Strings

<a name="using-short-keys"></a>
### Using Short Keys

Typically, translation strings are stored in files within the `resources/lang` directory. Within this directory there should be a subdirectory for each language supported by the application:

```php
    /resources
        /lang
            /en
                messages.php
            /es
                messages.php
```
All language files simply return an array of keyed strings. For example:

here find vul mostafa

```php
    <?php

    // resources/lang/en/messages.php

    return [
        'welcome' => 'Welcome to our application'
    ];
```

### Using Translation Strings As Keys

For applications with heavy translation requirements, defining every string with a short key can become quickly confusing when referencing them in your views. For this reason, Laravel also provides support for defining translation strings using the "default" translation of the string as the key.

Translation files that use translation strings as keys are stored as JSON files in the `resources/lang` directory. For example, if your application has a Spanish translation, you should create a `resources/lang/es.json` file:

```php
    {
        "I love programming.": "Me encanta la programaci√≥n."
    }
```

## Retrieving Translation Strings

You may retrieve lines from language files using the `__` helper function. The `__` method accepts the file and key of the translation string as its first argument. For example, let's retrieve the `welcome` translation string from the `resources/lang/messages.php` language file:

```php
    echo __('messages.welcome');

    echo __('I love programming.');
```


Of course if you are using the [Blade templating engine](), you may use the double curly braket   syntax to echo the translation string or use the `@lang` directive


```php
    {{ __('messages.welcome') }}

    @lang('messages.welcome')
```
If the specified translation string does not exist, the `__` function will simply return the translation string key. So, using the example above, the `__` function would return `messages.welcome` if the translation string does not exist.


### Replacing Parameters In Translation Strings

If you wish, you may define place-holders in your translation strings. All place-holders are prefixed with a `:`. For example, you may define a welcome message with a place-holder name:

```php

    'welcome' => 'Welcome, :name',

```
To replace the place-holders when retrieving a translation string, pass an array of replacements as the second argument to the `__` function:

```php
    echo __('messages.welcome', ['name' => 'dayle']);
```
If your place-holder contains all capital letters, or only has its first letter capitalized, the translated value will be capitalized accordingly:

```php
    'welcome' => 'Welcome, :NAME', // Welcome, DAYLE
    'goodbye' => 'Goodbye, :Name', // Goodbye, Dayle
```

<a name="pluralization"></a>
### Pluralization

Pluralization is a complex problem, as different languages have a variety of complex rules for pluralization. By using a "pipe" character, you may distinguish singular and plural forms of a string:

```php
    'apples' => 'There is one apple|There are many apples',
```

You may even create more complex pluralization rules which specify translation strings for multiple number ranges:

```php
    'apples' => '{0} There are none|[1,19] There are some|[20,*] There are many',
```

After defining a translation string that has pluralization options, you may use the `trans_choice` function to retrieve the line for a given "count". In this example, since the count is greater than one, the plural form of the translation string is returned:

```php
    echo trans_choice('messages.apples', 10);
```





## Overriding Package Language Files





Some packages may ship with their own language files. Instead of changing the package's core files to tweak these lines, you may override them by placing files in the `resources/lang/vendor/{package}/{locale}` directory.

So, for example, if you need to override the English translation strings in `messages.php` for a package named `skyrim/hearthfire`, you should place a language file at: `resources/lang/vendor/hearthfire/en/messages.php`. Within this file, you should only define the translation strings you wish to override. Any translation strings you don't override will still be loaded from the package's original language files.
